The Global Power Plant datset was taken from Kaggle data science community.The main objective of the project is to create dashboard of 
global power generation from various fuel source in power plants across the globe.

The data obtained is for the year 2020. Total installed capacity and generated power from all the plants are the major KPIs

I have provided the csv file of the dataset.

Using Tableau, data Filtering, data cleaning, table calculations, and finally creation of interactive dashboard is done.

Finally a broad insight of performance of power plants and utilization factor is obtained.
